#       Each cell type has to have a 'desc' line :
#       First column : 'desc'
#       Second column : ID  ( No special characters except underscore _  . Do not start with number. No whitespace. )
#       Third column : description (free text field)
#       
#       Cell type can have (optional) 'diff' line, listing possible differentiation states :
#       First column : 'diff'
#       Second column : ID  ( No special characters except underscore _  . Do not start with number. No whitespace. )
#       Third, fourth, etc columns :  Differentiation states.  ( No special characters except underscore _  . Do not start with number. No whitespace. )
#
#	All cell types have automatically diff states 'UNDIFF' and 'UNTREATED' (list the other ones in this file)
